# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** A modern web interface where I can experiment with RL algorithms, adjust parameters, and see learning happen in real-time through visualizations and metrics - making RL concepts concrete through hands-on exploration.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Web Infrastructure & Core Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Web Infrastructure & Core Loop)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-30 — Roadmap created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Web interface essential before RL work: Tkinter too frustrating for serious experimentation
- Focus on Q-learning first: Simplest algorithm for learning fundamentals
- Localhost-only deployment: Personal learning tool, no production requirements

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
