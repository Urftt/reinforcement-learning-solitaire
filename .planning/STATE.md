# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** A modern web interface where I can experiment with RL algorithms, adjust parameters, and see learning happen in real-time through visualizations and metrics - making RL concepts concrete through hands-on exploration.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Web Infrastructure & Core Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Web Infrastructure & Core Loop)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-30 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min)
- Trend: Just started

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Web interface essential before RL work: Tkinter too frustrating for serious experimentation
- Focus on Q-learning first: Simplest algorithm for learning fundamentals
- Localhost-only deployment: Personal learning tool, no production requirements
- ConnectionManager pattern for WebSocket state (01-01): Supports future multi-client scenarios
- JSON format for Q-table persistence (01-01): Human-readable, web-compatible
- Exponential epsilon decay (01-01): Standard RL practice for exploration-exploitation balance
- Action encoding 0=up, 1=down, 2=left, 3=right (01-01): Matches environment conventions

### Pending Todos
