# Project Milestones: GridWorld RL Learning Environment

## v1.0 GridWorld MVP (Shipped: 2026-02-01)

**Delivered:** Modern web-based GridWorld interface for learning reinforcement learning through hands-on experimentation with real-time visualization and metrics

**Phases completed:** 1-3 (8 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**
- Web-based RL training interface replacing dated Tkinter with FastAPI + WebSocket real-time communication
- Canvas-based 60fps agent visualization with per-step broadcasting pattern for fast RL environments
- Learning metrics dashboard with Chart.js charts (rewards, steps, epsilon), rolling averages, and CSV export
- Q-value heatmap visualization with red-to-green gradient showing learned state values
- Policy arrow visualization showing best actions per state with toggle controls
- Full parameter control (learning rate, epsilon, discount factor) with presets and persistence

**Stats:**
- 28 files created/modified
- ~4,031 lines of code (Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- 3 phases, 8 plans
- 7 days from start to ship

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `feat(03-02)`

**What's next:** Continue RL learning journey — explore additional algorithms (SARSA, DQN), experiment with different environments, build deeper intuition for hyperparameter effects
