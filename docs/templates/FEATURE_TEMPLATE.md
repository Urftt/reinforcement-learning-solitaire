<!-- Who benefits from this feature? -->

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
<!-- What must this feature do? -->

1. [ ] Requirement 1
2. [ ] Requirement 2
3. [ ] Requirement 3

### Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- Performance, security, usability, etc. -->

- **Performance**: [e.g., Must complete in < 100ms]
- **Security**: [e.g., Must validate all user input]
- **Usability**: [e.g., Must be intuitive for first-time users]

## Proposed Solution

**High-level approach**:
<!-- How will this be implemented? -->

**Technical details**:
<!-- Specific implementation notes -->

**Files to create/modify**:
- `src/module/new_file.py` - [Purpose]
- `src/module/existing_file.py` - [Changes needed]
- `tests/test_new_file.py` - [Test coverage]

## Design

**User flow** (if applicable):
```
1. User does X
2. System responds with Y
3. User sees Z
```

**API design** (if applicable):
```python
def function_name(param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
    """Brief description."""
    pass
```

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
<!-- Other features or external dependencies needed -->
- Feature-001: [Reason]
- Library X: [Why needed]

**Blocks**:
<!-- What can't be done until this is complete? -->
- Feature-005: [Reason]

## Implementation Plan
