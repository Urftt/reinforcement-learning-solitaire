# Milestone v1.0: GridWorld MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a modern web-based interface for experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms on GridWorld. Starting with core infrastructure that enables real-time training visualization, adding learning metrics to track progress, and culminating in advanced visualizations that reveal what the agent learned. Each phase built on the previous, creating a complete feedback loop for hands-on RL exploration.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Web Infrastructure & Core Loop

**Goal**: User can train Q-learning agent via web interface and see it learn in real-time
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: WEB-01, WEB-02, WEB-03, WEB-04, TRAIN-01, TRAIN-02, TRAIN-03, TRAIN-04, TRAIN-05, TRAIN-06, PARAM-01, PARAM-02, PARAM-03, PARAM-04, PARAM-05, VIZ-01, VIZ-02, VIZ-03, VIZ-04, QL-01, QL-02, QL-03, QL-04, QL-05
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Backend FastAPI server + Q-learning agent implementation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Frontend Canvas grid renderer + parameter controls UI
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Async training loop + WebSocket integration
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — End-to-end verification checkpoint

**Completed:** 2026-01-31

**Details:**
- FastAPI server with WebSocket endpoint for bidirectional communication
- Q-learning agent with epsilon-greedy policy and JSON persistence
- Canvas-based 60fps grid renderer with trail effects
- Parameter controls with sliders, inputs, and preset buttons
- Per-step broadcasting pattern discovered for fast RL environments
- Notification system for Q-table save/load operations
- User verified: "yes that's perfect!"

### Phase 2: Learning Metrics Dashboard

**Goal**: User can track learning progress through metrics and curves
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: METRIC-01, METRIC-02, METRIC-03, METRIC-04, METRIC-05
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Backend metrics emission + frontend data layer (IndexedDB, statistics)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Chart.js visualization, statistics panel, export/clear controls

**Completed:** 2026-02-01

**Details:**
- episode_complete WebSocket event broadcasting reward/steps/epsilon
- MetricsStorage class with IndexedDB persistence
- EpisodeStatistics class with 50-episode rolling averages
- Three Chart.js charts (rewards, steps, epsilon) with real-time updates
- Statistics panel showing total episodes, latest/avg/best reward
- Pause/Resume button that queues updates while paused
- CSV export and Clear Data functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualization

**Goal**: User can visualize what the agent learned (Q-values and policy)
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: QVAL-01, QVAL-02, QVAL-03, QVAL-04, POL-01, POL-02, POL-03, POL-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Backend Q-table transmission + toggle switch UI
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — GridRenderer overlay methods + wiring

**Completed:** 2026-02-01

**Details:**
- Q-table transmitted via WebSocket with episode_complete events
- Toggle switch UI for heatmap and policy arrow controls
- Q-value heatmap overlay with red-to-green gradient
- Policy arrow overlay showing best actions per state
- Layered canvas rendering (heatmap -> grid -> arrows -> entities)
- User verified: "approved"

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Per-step broadcasting instead of time-based throttling (GridWorld episodes complete in microseconds)
- asyncio.sleep(0) after broadcasts to yield to event loop for WebSocket delivery
- IndexedDB for metrics persistence (survives page refresh, no server storage)
- Chart.js via CDN (no build step needed)
- Canvas + requestAnimationFrame for 60fps visualization
- Red-to-green gradient for Q-values (matches "bad to good" convention)

**Issues Resolved:**
- NumPy JSON serialization blocking training start — converted to native Python types
- Visual updates not appearing — switched from time-based to per-step broadcasting
- Horizontal/vertical scrolling in sidebar — adjusted widths and spacing
- Q-table save/load had no user feedback — added notification system

**Issues Deferred:**
None — all phases completed without deferred items

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None — plans executed exactly as written
