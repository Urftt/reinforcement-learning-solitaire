# Requirements: GridWorld RL Learning Environment

**Defined:** 2026-01-30
**Core Value:** Modern web interface for experimenting with RL algorithms and seeing learning in real-time

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. All shipped successfully.

### Web Infrastructure (4/4)

- [x] **WEB-04**: Backend API responds to training control commands within 100ms

### Training Control (6/6)

- [x] **TRAIN-01**: User can start training session from web interface
- [x] **TRAIN-02**: User can stop training session at any time
- [x] **TRAIN-03**: User can reset environment to start new training run
- [x] **TRAIN-04**: Training runs in background without blocking web interface
- [x] **TRAIN-05**: User sees current episode number during training
- [x] **TRAIN-06**: User sees current step count during training

### Parameter Configuration (5/5)

- [x] **PARAM-01**: User can adjust learning rate before starting training
- [x] **PARAM-02**: User can adjust epsilon (exploration rate) before starting training
- [x] **PARAM-03**: User can adjust discount factor (gamma) before starting training
- [x] **PARAM-04**: Parameter changes take effect on next training run
- [x] **PARAM-05**: Current parameter values are displayed in UI

### Real-Time Visualization (4/4)

- [x] **VIZ-01**: User sees agent position update in real-time during training
- [x] **VIZ-02**: Grid visualization shows obstacles and goal clearly
- [x] **VIZ-03**: Agent movement is smooth and tracks training progress
- [x] **VIZ-04**: Visualization updates at least 10 times per second during training

### Learning Metrics (5/5)

- [x] **METRIC-01**: User sees episode reward plotted in real-time learning curve
- [x] **METRIC-02**: Learning curve updates smoothly without blocking training
- [x] **METRIC-03**: User sees current episode reward value
- [x] **METRIC-04**: User sees rolling average of recent episode rewards
- [x] **METRIC-05**: Metrics are preserved across page refreshes during training

### Q-Value Visualization (4/4)

- [x] **QVAL-01**: User can view Q-value heatmap for all grid states
- [x] **QVAL-02**: Q-values update in real-time as agent learns
- [x] **QVAL-03**: Color scale clearly shows relative state values
- [x] **QVAL-04**: User can toggle Q-value display on/off

### Policy Visualization (4/4)

- [x] **POL-01**: User can view learned policy as action arrows on grid
- [x] **POL-02**: Policy arrows show best action for each state
- [x] **POL-03**: Policy visualization updates as agent learns
- [x] **POL-04**: User can toggle policy display on/off

### Q-Learning Implementation (5/5)

- [x] **QL-01**: Q-learning agent trains on GridWorld environment
- [x] **QL-02**: Agent updates Q-table based on experience
- [x] **QL-03**: Agent uses epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- [x] **QL-04**: Agent converges to optimal policy on easy difficulty
- [x] **QL-05**: Q-table persists across training sessions

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked in PROJECT.md Active section.

### Advanced Visualization

- **ADV-VIZ-01**: State visitation heatmap showing exploration coverage
- **ADV-VIZ-02**: Animated training progress playback
- **ADV-VIZ-03**: Multi-metric overlay (reward + steps + epsilon on same chart)
- **ADV-VIZ-04**: Test/rollout mode separate from training metrics

### Experimentation Tools

- **EXP-01**: Save trained agents to disk
- **EXP-02**: Load previously trained agents
- **EXP-03**: Side-by-side comparison of different training runs
- **EXP-04**: Training speed control (slow-mo mode)
- **EXP-05**: Statistical comparison with confidence intervals
- **EXP-06**: State-action heatmap visualization

### Additional Algorithms

- **ALG-01**: SARSA algorithm implementation
- **ALG-02**: Algorithm comparison interface
- **ALG-03**: Algorithm performance metrics

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile interface | Desktop browser sufficient for learning; mobile adds complexity without value |
| Multi-user support | Personal learning tool, localhost only |
| Cloud deployment | Educational tool for local use only |
| Real-time 3D visualization | Distracts from learning; 2D grid is clearer for understanding |
| Automated hyperparameter search | Defeats learning purpose - users need to tune manually to understand effects |
| Complex dashboard with 8+ panels | Research shows simpler UIs drive better learning |
| Reward smoothing by default | Hides training instability that learners need to see |
| Production-grade authentication | Localhost only, single user |
| Database for experiment tracking (v1) | Deferred to v2; file-based persistence sufficient initially |
